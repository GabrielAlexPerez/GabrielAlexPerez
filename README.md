ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GabrielAlexPerez

I graduated from Stanford University in June 2021 with a BS in Mechanical Engineering, with a concentration in Dynamic Systems and Controls. Iâ€™m particularly interest in exploring the fields of Robotics and Autonomous Systems.

Currently, I;m work at MathWorks focusing on Control Design Automation and Autonomous Vehicles.
